Universel selector: *{ }
grouping selector: .read, .unread { }
chaining selectors: .subsection.header{ }
Descendant Combinator: .ancestor .contents { }

CSS CASCADE: 
1/ Specificity 
inline css > internal css > external css
ID selectors > Class selectors  > Type selectors 
more specified take the lead (amounts of each selector type)
(+, ~, >, *, and the empty space) have no specificity value
2/ Inheritance: 
use mostly for Typography based properties.
3/ Rule Order: 
the last defined is the winner.
